## **GitHub Documents**

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## **Flights Code**
You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(flights)
```

## **Flights Plot**

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(flights, aes(x = carrier, fill = origin)) +
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge(preserve = "single")) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
